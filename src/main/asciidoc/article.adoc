Domain-driven design (DDD), is an approach used to build systems that have a complex business domain. So you wouldn’t apply DDD to, say, infrastructure software or building routers, proxies, or caching layers, but instead to business software that solves real-world business problems. It’s a great technique for separating the way the business is modeled from the plumbing code that ties it all together. Separating these two in the software itself makes it easier to design, model, build and evolve an implementation over time.

In the implementation, DDD building blocks play an important role in how business is modeled into the code. In this article, I will take you through the best available options for building blocks in object-oriented principles.
